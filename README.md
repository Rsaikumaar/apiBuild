<h1>PyQt</h1>
PyQt: PyQt is a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework. 
Similar to Tkinter, PyQt is primarily used for desktop application development.
However, PyQt does offer a module called PyQtMobile, which provides some support for developing mobile applications using Qt. 
PyQtMobile enables you to create mobile apps with PyQt that can run on Android and iOS devices.
